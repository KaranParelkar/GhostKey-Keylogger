# GhostKey-Keylogger
This Python script is a keylogger tool designed to capture keystrokes on a system. It utilizes the pynput library to monitor keyboard input and saves the logged keystrokes into a text file (keylog.txt by default). The script runs in the background and records all keystrokes made by the user.
